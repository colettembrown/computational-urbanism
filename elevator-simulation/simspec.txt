- randomly generate user defined number of passengers with a random destination and floor
- Array of passenger calls that need to be handled with generated from passengers within for loop
- [1,2,3,4,5]
- pick up passengers going in the same direction ()

{(Passenger 1, Start 1, Destination 5,up),
 (Passenger 2, Start 3, Destination 1,down),
 (Passenger 3, Start 3, Destination 10,up),
 (Passenger 4, Start 3, Destination 2,down),
 (Passenger 5, Start 2, Destination 4,up),
 (Passenger 6, Start 2, Destination 7,up),
 (Passenger 7, Start 5, Destination 3,down)}

Strategy

If elevator is going up:
  destination is max(maximum destination of passengers goin up,
                    maximum starting floor of passengers going down)
If elevator going down:
  the reverse
